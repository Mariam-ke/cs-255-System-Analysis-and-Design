## DriverPass project

The DriverPass project was a system analysis and design project requested by a company who wanted to have an online system that allows students to have better driving training. The CEO Liam noticed there is a gap in local department of motor vehicles (DMV) with training students and therefore a lot of the students end up failing their driving tests.
DriverPass wanted us to design an online application that allows students to book and reserve both in-person and driving practice lessons. 

What I would say I did particularly well was to define both functional requirements, non-functional requirements, technical requirements as well as limitations that the system has.
What I would like to revise would be the UML Class diagram as I felt this was incomplete and there could be more features that should be captured in the diagram. I focused on the main goal and objective of the user which would be to efficiently use the system to learn and therefore with this in mind I designed a system that would be easy to use for all users internal and external, since the user is the main customer, it is important to design a system that will be easy for them to use rather than a pain.

The best approach to designing software would be system analysis since this works with collecting information about the system and helps in understanding various aspects of operations and in determining the functional requirements of the system and the software. In the future, I would use structured design techniques as these help developers to deal with the size and complexity of programs.
